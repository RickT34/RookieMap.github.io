- [Attention is all you need by Alexander M. Rush](https://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/annotated-transformer/)
	This post presents an annotated version of the paper in the form of a line-by-line implementation. It reorders and deletes some sections from the original paper and adds comments throughout. This document itself is a working notebook, and should be a completely usable implementation. Code is available [HERE](https://github.com/harvardnlp/annotated-transformer/).
