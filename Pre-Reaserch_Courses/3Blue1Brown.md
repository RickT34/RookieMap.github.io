- [But what is a Neural Network?](https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/neural-networks)
- [Gradient descent, how neural networks learn](https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/gradient-descent)
- [Analyzing our neural network](https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/neural-network-analysis)
- [What is backpropagation really doing?](https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/backpropagation)
- [Backpropagation calculus](https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/backpropagation-calculus#title)
